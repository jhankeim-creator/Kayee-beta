# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Frequency control working (every_visit), responsive on mobile (390x80px), close button accessible. Overlay blocks interactions properly. ✅ FOOTER DYNAMIC CONTENT: External links working perfectly - 'Guide d'achat', 'Link 2', 'Link 3' displayed in Quick Links section. Social media icons (18 found) properly integrated. ✅ PASSWORD RESET FLOW: Both /forgot-password and /reset-password pages load correctly with proper form elements and validation. ✅ TRACK ORDER PAGE: Loads correctly with proper form elements and error handling for invalid orders. ⚠️ ADMIN LOGIN ISSUE: Floating announcement popup blocks login button clicks - this is a UI overlay issue that needs fixing. Backend admin authentication works perfectly (confirmed via API: kayicom509@gmail.com / Admin123! returns valid JWT token). All frontend features are working except admin UI access due to popup interference."

PAYMENT GATEWAYS (Passerelles de Paiement): Complete CRUD operations working - GET/POST/DELETE payment gateways, manual PayPal gateway creation with instructions, Stripe gateway creation, proper deletion ✅ 2. SOCIAL LINKS (Liens Sociaux): Full CRUD with both admin and public endpoints - created Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp links, public endpoint works without auth, deletion successful ✅ 3. EXTERNAL LINKS (Liens Externes - Max 3): Max 3 limit properly enforced - existing 3 links found, 4th link correctly rejected with 'Maximum 3 external links allowed' error, limit validation working ✅ 4. FLOATING ANNOUNCEMENT (Annonce Flottante): Complete Shein-style popup management - admin and public endpoints working, update with French content successful ('Promo Spéciale!', 'Réduction de 25%'), disable functionality working ✅ 5. BULK EMAIL (Emails en Masse): Newsletter system fully functional - sent test email to 3 customers successfully, email history retrieval working with 3 emails in database ✅ 6. TEAM MANAGEMENT (Gestion d'Équipe): Complete CRUD operations - retrieved 4 existing team members, created new member with specific permissions (manage_products: true, manage_orders: true), updated member permissions successfully, deleted member successfully ✅ 7. GOOGLE ANALYTICS: Configuration management working - public endpoint accessible, admin update successful with tracking ID 'G-TEST123456' and privacy settings. ❌ MINOR ISSUES: 3 external link creation tests failed with HTTP 400 (likely due to existing 3-link limit already reached). ALL CRITICAL ADMIN FUNCTIONALITIES ARE WORKING PERFECTLY! Authentication with admin@luxe.com / Admin123! successful. All CRUD operations, permission validations, and data persistence working as expected."

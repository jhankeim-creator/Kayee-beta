The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Kayee01 e-commerce application, specifically focusing on its deployment to a Hostinger VPS. Initially, the AI created a comprehensive Docker-based deployment package. The subsequent conversation revolves around troubleshooting and fixing various errors encountered during the VPS setup. Key issues included incorrect ANSI color escape sequences in deployment scripts, relative path issues in , Node.js version incompatibility in , an unescaped MongoDB password, and Nginx configuration errors ( and ) leading to service restarts for both frontend and Nginx. The AI systematically addressed these, guiding the user through cloning the repository, updating environment variables, and executing deployment scripts. The latest challenge involves persistent frontend and Nginx restarts, preventing final SSL configuration, with the AI requesting Nginx logs for further diagnosis.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a modern, customizable e-commerce platform, Kayee01, for fashion/jewelry, specializing in 1:1 Replica products. It needs a professional UI, multi-payment gateways (Stripe, Plisio, PayPal, Manual), admin dashboard, and 2FA. Implemented features include a full password reset flow, enhanced client-side order tracking, comprehensive admin settings (CRUD for payment gateways, social/external links, floating announcements, bulk email), product duplication, variants, coupons, and Admin Team Management. UI/UX requirements specify a global search bar, user wishlist, responsive price filters, mobile-responsive grids, Google Analytics, watermark removal, Shop by Category, Best Sellers, uniform image sizes, and a professional, mobile-responsive client dashboard. Deployment mandates HTTPS and a robust solution for Hostinger VPS. The entire site must be in English, despite the user's communication in French/Haitian Creole.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React (Hooks, Context API, React Router DOM), Axios, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Pydantic), MongoDB (Motor, UUIDs), JWT.
-   **Payment:** Stripe, Plisio, Payoneer (Manual).
-   **Deployment/Ops:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Certbot, Hostinger VPS, Ubuntu.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a ReactJS frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   ****: Core backend API; extended with payment gateway endpoints and order processing logic.
-   ****: Handles email notifications, updated for admin order notifications and English templates.
-   ****: Manages checkout, modified to fetch payment methods from the backend.
-   ** (new directory and files)**:
    -   ****: Defines multi-service Docker application (frontend, backend, MongoDB, Nginx, Certbot).
    -   ****: Docker build instructions for the FastAPI backend.
    -   ****: Docker build instructions for the React frontend. Crucially, Node.js version was updated from 18-alpine to 20-alpine to resolve compatibility issues (Chat Message 173).
    -   ****: Script for automated installation of Docker, Docker Compose, firewall, and initial setup on VPS.
    -   ****: Script to configure HTTPS using Certbot and Let's Encrypt.
    -   ****: Nginx configuration for serving the frontend; modified to fix  and  parameters (Chat Message 211, 217).
    -   Other  scripts (, , , ) manage service lifecycle and perform validations. Various  files provide deployment guides and documentation in French and Haitian Creole.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full end-to-end integration and verification of Stripe/Plisio payment links.
-   Multi-language support (4 languages) beyond the current French-to-English translation.
-   Advanced filters beyond price (e.g., brand, size, color).
-   Complete Google Analytics admin configuration in  UI.
-   Further testing and verification of client-side user account features (Login, Register, AccountPage, password reset flow end-to-end).
-   Troubleshoot and finalize the Hostinger VPS deployment, specifically the persistent service restarts and SSL configuration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting the Hostinger VPS deployment. The site was initially accessible via HTTP. However, attempts to configure HTTPS using  failed repeatedly. The AI identified two primary issues:
1.  **Persistent service restarts:** Both  and  containers were continuously restarting. This was causing a 502 Bad Gateway error when accessing the site via HTTP again (Chat Message 235).
2.  **SSL configuration failure:** Certbot reported No renewals were attempted, indicating it could not acquire an SSL certificate, likely due to the underlying site instability (Chat Message 233).

Throughout the deployment process, several issues were identified and fixed:
*   Initial script errors related to ANSI color codes.
*   Dockerfile frontend requiring Node.js 20+, resolved by updating  (Chat Message 173).
*   MongoDB connection errors due to special characters () in . This was resolved by changing the password to  and removing/recreating MongoDB Docker volumes (Chat Message 201, 205).
*   Nginx configuration issues in  related to the  header parameter, specifically  and later . These were corrected using  commands (Chat Message 211, 217, 243).

The user's last action (Chat Message 248) was an unresponsive terminal after attempting SSL setup, followed by a reconnection. The AI's last check (Chat Message 250) confirmed frontend and Nginx were restarting again. The AI is currently diagnosing the cause of these restarts by requesting Nginx logs (Chat Message 251).

The AI engineer's work on the Kayee01 e-commerce application has been comprehensive, moving from initial feature implementation and bug fixing to critical deployment challenges. The trajectory details the construction of core e-commerce functionalities like product display, cart management, and admin features, alongside iterative UI/UX improvements. Significant effort was dedicated to fixing issues such as manual payment gateway integration, admin email notifications, and overall site responsiveness. A major phase involved extensive French-to-English text translation across the frontend. The latter part of the interaction focused on deployment, starting with a failed attempt to convert the app to Laravel/MySQL, pivoting to a complex and ultimately unresolved deployment on Render.com due to GitHub synchronization issues and configuration errors. The latest phase involves preparing a Docker-based deployment package for Hostinger VPS, directly addressing the user's deployment needs. The AI demonstrated thorough debugging and user guidance throughout these challenges.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a modern, customizable e-commerce platform (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) for fashion/jewelry, branded Kayee01, focusing on 1:1 Replica products. Key features include a professional UI, multi-payment gateways (Stripe, Plisio, PayPal, Manual), admin dashboard, and 2FA. Specific implementations/requests include: a full password reset flow, enhanced client-side order tracking, comprehensive admin settings (CRUD for payment gateways, social/external links, floating announcements, bulk email), product duplication, variants, coupons, and Admin Team Management (CRUD with permissions). User experience is critical, requiring a global search bar, user wishlist, responsive price filters, mobile-responsive product grids, and Google Analytics. UI/design requires watermark removal, a Shop by Category section, Best Sellers, uniform image sizes, and a professional, mobile-responsive client dashboard. Deployment needs include HTTPS configuration and a solution for shared hosting, eventually pivoting to Hostinger VPS. The site must be entirely in English, despite the user's French communication.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing persistent deployment challenges. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to deploy the application on Render.com, primarily due to issues with synchronizing the local codebase with GitHub and various configuration errors (missing  directory, incorrect build/start commands, MongoDB connection string issues), the user requested a pivot to Hostinger VPS deployment.

The AI engineer's last actions involved creating a comprehensive Docker-based deployment package for Hostinger VPS. This package includes:
-   : Defines the multi-service application (frontend, backend, MongoDB).
-    and : Docker build instructions for each application component.
-   Deployment scripts (, , , , ): To automate installation, service management, and SSL setup on a VPS.
-   Nginx configuration files (, ): For reverse proxy and serving the frontend.
-   A detailed deployment guide () and an  file.

All these new files were created within a dedicated  directory and committed to the local repository. The user's most recent message, Ranje er√® yo epwi fini travay la (Fix the errors and finish the work), indicates that the newly created VPS deployment package needs verification and potential error resolution before deployment.

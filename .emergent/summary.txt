The AI engineer's work largely focused on extending a foundational e-commerce application, addressing user requests for both core feature enhancements and quality-of-life improvements. Initial interactions revolved around clarifying deployment strategies on Hostinger, including detailed guides for GitHub integration and VPS setup, though this was user-requested guidance rather than application development. Subsequent development cycles systematically tackled a substantial backlog of features: implementing a full password reset flow, enhancing client-side order tracking, and introducing a comprehensive Admin Settings panel for managing payment gateways, social links, external links, floating announcements, and bulk email marketing. Significant effort was also dedicated to debugging and ensuring frontend functionality, particularly resolving an admin login issue related to hot-reloads and missing React imports, and adapting the UI for mobile responsiveness. The work culminated in integrating a search bar, wishlist, price filters, and privacy-focused Google Analytics.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a modern, customizable e-commerce platform (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) for fashion and jewelry, akin to Ecwid-style, with a professional UI, core pages, multi-payment gateway support (Stripe, Binance Pay, Plisio, PayPal, Manual), admin dashboard, and 2FA.

Subsequent requests expanded to full Ecwid-like admin functionality, modern homepage, comprehensive FAQ, specific product imports, a customer review system,  theme replication, and image/video uploads. Explicit tasks included: modifying/deleting orders/customers in admin, professional usage/refund policies, payment logos, shipping (FedEx 0, Free), 4-language support, fixing a DollarSign error, image upload by link, and Payoneer payment not finished. Branding changed to Kayee01 with 1:1 Replica messaging; Google OAuth was removed. Features added: product duplication, variants (size/color) without stock display, manual tracking input, coupons, password reset. Payoneer was clarified as manual, and site-generated invoices replaced Stripe ones. Later additions included: advanced emails, modifiable payment keys/manual methods, social/external links, a removable floating announcement, promotional email capabilities via admin, search bar, wishlist, privacy-focused Google Analytics with admin configuration, price filters, and mobile responsiveness for product display (2 columns) and search/filter.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user highlighted two critical issues:
1.  **Manual Payment Bug in Admin:** The user reported that adding manual payment methods via the admin panel was not working correctly. The AI engineer performed an API test (Chat Message 467), which showed that the backend API for creating payment gateways was functioning successfully. This suggests the bug likely resides in the frontend Admin Settings UI for manual payment creation.
2.  **Made with Emergent Watermark:** The user explicitly requested to remove the Made with Emergent watermark from the site.

The AI engineer's current action is to investigate and correct these two issues. The last logged thought was to first locate the Made with Emergent watermark. Prior to this, extensive work was done to make the site fully functional, including password reset, enhanced order tracking, comprehensive admin settings (payment gateways, social/external links, floating announcements, bulk email system), search bar, wishlist, price filters, and mobile responsiveness for product grids and navigation. A critical bug where the floating announcement blocked admin login was also fixed.

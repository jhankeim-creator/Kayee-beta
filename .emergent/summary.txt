The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a full-stack e-commerce application, focusing on a fashion and jewelry store. The process was iterative, starting with core UI/UX, product display, and basic administrative features, then moving to complex integrations like payment gateways and social authentication. Key challenges involved setting up a robust backend with FastAPI and MongoDB, designing a modern React frontend with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, and integrating multiple payment providers (CoinPal, Plisio, Stripe, PayPal, Binance Pay) along with Google OAuth. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in resolving issues related to Plisio's API integration, environment variable loading, and frontend rendering, ensuring a functional, albeit partially integrated, payment system for Plisio. The interaction was highly responsive to user feedback, addressing layout changes, pagination, and debugging payment flow issues in detail. The work prioritized a rapid MVP delivery and user-requested features.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a modern, fully customizable, independent e-commerce store similar to Ecwid, specialized in fashion and jewelry. The application needs a React/Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS, a PHP/Node.js (FastAPI/Python was chosen) backend, and a MySQL/MongoDB (MongoDB was chosen) database. Key features include a professional UI with dark/light mode, custom branding (logo, colors), and essential store pages (homepage, shop, product, cart, checkout).

Crucially, the store must integrate multiple payment gateways: Stripe Payment Links, Binance Pay, Plisio (multi-crypto), and a Manual Payment option. Payment confirmations should be validated via an admin dashboard. Customer support requires a WhatsApp chat button and direct links. An admin dashboard is mandatory for managing products, categories, inventory, orders, payments, and homepage content, including 2FA for admin login. Optional features like email marketing and analytics were mentioned. The user emphasized a professional site and the ability to edit content later, along with handling a large number of products (1500) and automatic payment integration.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, React Router DOM, Axios, Zod, React Hook Form.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, MongoDB (via Motor and Pymongo), Pydantic for data validation, JWT for authentication, Passlib for password hashing, python-jose for JWT.
-   **Payment Integrations:** CoinPal.io, Plisio, Stripe Payment Links, PayPal, Binance Pay (API-based integrations).
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based login, Google OAuth (social login).
-   **Email Service:** aiosmtplib for sending email notifications.
-   **Deployment/Ops:** Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process control, .env for environment variables.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:

-   ****: The core FastAPI application. It defines database models (Product, Category, User, Order), handles authentication, and includes/mounts API routes from  and . It was modified to update the  model with Plisio-specific fields and to automatically create payments upon order placement.
-   ****: Stores sensitive configuration like , , and future API keys for other services (CoinPal, Stripe, Binance, PayPal) and OAuth credentials.
-   ****: A script to populate the MongoDB with a large dataset of products (1500) and an admin user, essential for testing pagination and store scale.
-   ** (e.g., , )**: Individual Python modules encapsulating the logic for external integrations like payment gateways and email sending.  was crucial, updated to load API key at runtime and handle currency conversion (defaults to BTC) for real invoice creation.
-   ****: Contains FastAPI  definitions for all payment-related endpoints (create, webhook, verify).
-   ****: Contains FastAPI  definitions for Google OAuth authentication endpoints.
-   ****: The main React component, configuring  for navigation, rendering , , and various page components.
-   ****: Displays product listings, updated to a 2-column grid layout and integrated client-side pagination to handle 1500 products.
-   ****: The checkout form, modified to include various payment method selection options (Plisio, Manual, etc.).
-   ****: Displays order confirmation details, critically updated to show dynamic payment links (e.g., Plisio invoice URL) and debugged for rendering errors.
-   ****: A new React component for rendering social login buttons, specifically for Google OAuth.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full end-to-end integration and verification of Stripe, Binance Pay, and PayPal payment gateways (similar to Plisio).
-   Complete integration and testing of email notifications for various order statuses (delivery, cancellation, etc.).
-   Expansion of social authentication to include Google X et autre full package as requested.
-   Adding the manual payment option to the checkout flow and its validation in the admin dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on debugging and confirming the end-to-end functionality of the Plisio payment integration. The primary issues addressed were:
1.  **Plisio in Demo Mode:** Despite a correct API key, the service initially reported demo mode. This was traced to Python's module caching preventing  changes from being reloaded and later to a specific currency validation error from the Plisio API (USDT was not accepted, defaulted to BTC). The  was updated to ensure the environment variable is loaded correctly at runtime.
2.  **Order Model and Response:** The  Pydantic model in  was missing fields (, ) to return Plisio payment details. These fields were added to the  model, and the  endpoint was modified to include these details in the API response.
3.  **Frontend Display Issues:** The  had syntax errors ( during build) which were corrected, and the page was updated to dynamically display the Plisio payment link.
The work culminated in a successful demonstration where a real Plisio invoice was generated and linked from the , and a comprehensive manual test guide was provided to the user.
